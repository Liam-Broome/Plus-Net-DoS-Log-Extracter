# Plus-Net-DoS-Log-Extracter
Retrieve DoS details from Plus Net routers.

This project gathers DoS information from your PlusNet event logs.
Simply add your Event log to a PHP project alongside the script and name the log 'log.csv'.

It will build a HTML table on screen, including the following information.

Date & Time, 
Source Attacker, 
Region, 
Country, 
City, 
ZIP/Postal Code, 
Coordinates, 

Within the script a statement is hardcoded, 
Due to the API not having premium access, the data is only allowed to be gathered with limits, you can ammend this by getting the premium access to the 
API. 

Project was only a mash together to retreive data from some attackers, so this is not a representation of my quality work. 

However, I am sure other PlusNet customers can use this so I publicly released it.
